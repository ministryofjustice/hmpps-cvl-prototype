<p class="govuk-body">The last approved version of a licence will now be saved to your vary case list if you change something without getting the licence reapproved by the prison before someone’s release date. </br></br>
  For example, you might have needed to change something at the last minute after a late request from the victim liaison officer or MAPPA.</br></br>
  Previously, approved licences that were changed without being reapproved in time were removed from the Create and vary a licence service.</br></br>
  You can now find them on the case list you see when you select the “View and vary” tile after you sign in.

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s" style="margin-left: 15px;">Reviewing a saved licence</h3>
<p class="govuk-body" style="margin-left: 15px;">Because the version of the licence saved to this case list will not contain your most recent changes, you should review it and then vary it to add any missing information needed. You can then submit a variation request to your PDU head.</br></br>

  Once approved, you must make the licence active and then print it for the person on probation to sign at their next appointment.</br></br>
  
  To help you keep track of changes you make to a licence, a version number will now be shown at the bottom of each page. Each change made to a licence before release will be recorded as 1.1, then 1.2, 1.3. Each variation made after release will be shown as 2, 3 and 4.</br></br></p>
  
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" style="margin-left: 15px;">Making last-minute changes to a licence </h3>
  
  <p class="govuk-body" style="margin-left: 15px;">Licences should be sent to the prison for approval in plenty of time before someone’s release date. </br></br>
  
  You should only make last-minute changes to an approved licence when it is absolutely necessary. </br></br>
  If you need to make a last-minute change to someone’s licence before their release, you should consider either:

  <ul class="govuk-body">
    <li>contacting the prison’s Offender Management Unit directly and ensuring they approve the changes before release</li>
    <li>waiting until after someone has been released and then varying the licence with approval from your PDU head</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
